# OOP Basics

This class is going to cover the basics of oop

## Covered in this class:
4 pillars:
- abstraction
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- encapsulation

Other learning outcomes:
- Git + Github
- Documentation
- Best practices and organisation

### Definitions
Add definitions here:

**class** 
- is a blueprint of an object
- it wraps methods and attributes

**methods** 
- take in arguements and run code but can only be used by
an instance of it's class

**attributes** 
- hold information about our specific object
- set in the def __init__(self) 

**def __init__(self)**

- aka constructor or initial iser
- this method runs every time an object is created
```
 animal1 = Animal('simba', 2, 4)
```
**instance/object**
are an occurence of an object

**self**
refers to the object/instance

**inheritance**
is the ability of classes to inherit characteristics (parameters)
 and behaviours (methods) from parent classes
 
 **polymorphism** 
 polymorphism means many forms
 - poly means many, and morph means forms
 - in OOP is the ability to change methods and characteristics of instances 
 of child classes
 - method polymorphism 
 
 **abstraction**
 is hiding complexity from the user
 - heating food in the microwave 
 - changing gears in a car
 - coding languages and binary in computing
 
 Specifif to us:
 - we will write nice documentation for how to import and use our code
 - use inheritance and importing to hide code
 - we can package it into a module that could be imported with PIP
